## Project Overview
### Problem Statement
MovieLens is a web-based recommender system that proposes movies to its users. It is faced with the task of improving its services by proposing movies that suit their users' preferences. We focus on helping MovieLens by creating predictive models for recommending movies to users based on their taste in terms of genres and based on the best-rated movies. 


#### Objectives
* To **Generate accurate movie recommendations for each user.**
* To **Identify similar users.**
* To **Enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing tailored movie suggestions that align with their preferences.**
* To **create a recommendation system that utilizes collaborative filtering to analyze user ratings.**
## Data
The data was sourced from MovieLens, and has been merged to have a total of 100836 rows and 6 columns.
## Data Preparation
We prepared the data by merging datasets, getting its statistical summary, checked for duplicated and null values.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
We did visualization using plots to understand the genre distribution, rating frequency, and that of highly and lowly rated movies.
